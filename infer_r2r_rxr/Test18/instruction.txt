Go straight along the black striped tiles on the floor. Pass the first gray pillar, and once you're nearly at the second one, turn left. Then, keep going straight. When you reach the glass railing in front of you, turn right, and continue straight to the gray door. Once you are near the gray door, turn left and proceed to the glass wall. Come to a halt at the glass wall to complete the path.
