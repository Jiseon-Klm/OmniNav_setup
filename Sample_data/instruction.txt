Walk forward along the white wall. Once you are close to the passage on your right, make a right turn and enter the passage. Continue walking straight, following the black striped tiles on the floor. After passing the fire hydrant, turn slightly to the right and move forward until you see a black sofa. Walk towards the black sofa and stop in front of it to finalize the trajectory.
